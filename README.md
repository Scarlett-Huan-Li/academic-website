## Research Interests

Huan Li focuses on the large-scale and long-term spatio-temporal data analysis based on multi-source remote sensing and GIS. Specifically, she is interested in interdisciplinary studies, including inland water body monitoring, global water cycle, polar sea ice, climate change, and limnology. At meantime, she tries to make all scientific data and results accessible to both scientists and the non-experts such as the government and the general public, through open code, shared data, and interactive user interface, mainly based on Google Earth Engine.
